# D&D Character Sheet Prototype

This is a web-based prototype for Dungeons & Dragons character sheets.  
Each sheet is tied to a unique URL and can be linked to a physical card via QR code.

## Goals
- Editable character sheet
- Unique URLs per character
- Auto-saving of data
- Eventually integrate with a backend (e.g., Supabase or Firebase)

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Hosted on Netlify
- Data stored in `localStorage` for prototype

## Future Ideas
- Cloud-based data storage
- QR code generation tool
- AR character visualization
